    <div class="LeftTextp"> The Wheel of Time TV show started in 2021 and has had
        a mixed reception. Major criticisms have been leveled for its unwillingness 
        to follow and respect the source material, with many major plot points and
        Characters skipped or handled incorrectly. Season 2 released in September 
        2023 and was met with a more jovial, if still mixed reception. The story
        took steps closer to the source material and handled certain elements
        and characters better than season 1. Season 3 is slated to release March 13th, 
        2025 and promotional material is showing a further increase in quality and 
        faithfulness to the books, even though rearrangements of major events are occurring. 
        Season four is not yet green lit pending viewership figures on season 3. </div>
